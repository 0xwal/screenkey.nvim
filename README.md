# Screenkey.nvim

Screenkey is a Neovim plugin that displays the keys you are typing in a floating window,
just like [screenkey](https://www.thregr.org/wavexx/software/screenkey/) does.
It is useful for screencasts, presentations, and live coding sessions.

    <summary>Default settings:</summary>


```lua
{
    -- see :h nvim_open_win
    win_opts = {
        relative = "editor",
        anchor = "SE",
        width = 40,
        height = 3,
        border = "single",
    },
    -- compress input when repeated <compress_after> times
    compress_after = 3,
    -- clear the input after <clear_after> seconds of inactivity
    clear_after = 3,
}
```
</details>

## ‚ùì How to use
- `:Screenkey` to toggle the screenkey
- Don't worry about leaking your passwords when using `sudo` while streaming/recording because you forgot to turn your display-key application,
`Screenkey` will only show pieces of information about your input in Neovim.

## üëÄ Similar projects and some differences
- [keys.nvim](https://github.com/tamton-aquib/keys.nvim):
    - As of the last update of this README, **keys.nvim** cannot process the literal keys you type - for example if you have `<c-d>` mapped to `<c-d>zz`, when you press
    `<c-d>` **keys.nvim** will show `^d z z` instead of `^d`.
    - Screenkey has `compress_after` option that enables it to compress your input - for example `jjjjjj` will be displayed as `j..x6`, which is usually way easier
    to read and will save up a lot of space.
