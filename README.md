# Screenkey.nvim

Screenkey is a Neovim plugin that displays the keys you are typing in a floating window,
just like [screenkey](https://www.thregr.org/wavexx/software/screenkey/) does.
It is useful for screencasts, presentations, and live coding sessions.

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `win_opts`          | see `:h nvim_open_win`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `compress after`    | compress input when repeated <compress_after> times (for example `jjjj` will be compressed to `j..x4`)                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `clear_after`       | clear the input after `<clear_after>` seconds of inactivity                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `disable`           | temporarily disable screenkey (for example when inside of the terminal)                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `disable.filetypes` | for example: `toggleterm` or `toml`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `disable.buftypes`  | see `:h 'buftype'`, for example: `terminal`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `win_opts`          | see `:h nvim_open_win`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `group_mappings`    | for example: `<leader>sf` opens up a fuzzy finder, if the `group_mappings` option is set to `true`, every time you open up a fuzzy finder with `<leader>sf`, Screenkey will show `‚ê£sf` instead of `‚ê£ s f` to indicate that the used key combination was a defined mapping. |

## ‚ùì How to use

-   `:Screenkey` to toggle the screenkey
-   Don't worry about leaking your passwords when using `sudo` while streaming/recording because you forgot to turn your display-key application,
    `Screenkey` will only show pieces of information about your input in Neovim.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using a terminal inside of the Neovim, and you want screenkey to automatically stop displaying your keys when you're inside of the terminal, see `disable` option in the plugin configuration.

## üëÄ Similar projects and some differences

-   [keys.nvim](https://github.com/tamton-aquib/keys.nvim):
    -   As of the last update of this README, **keys.nvim** cannot process the literal keys you type - for example if you have `<c-d>` mapped to `<c-d>zz`, when you press
        `<c-d>` **keys.nvim** will show `^d z z` instead of `^d`.
    -   Screenkey has `compress_after` option that enables it to compress your input - for example `jjjjjj` will be displayed as `j..x6`, which is usually way easier
        to read and will save up a lot of space.
